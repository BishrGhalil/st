# My st (simple terminal) build

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.  This is my personal build of st.  I used a number of patches in this build to make st more "sensible" rather than "suckless."  The patches I added to this build include:
+ alpha (for transparency)
+ font2 (to allow setting more than one font, useful when the default font has missing glyphs)
+ scrollback (scrollback through terminal using Shift+PageUp/PageDown.)
+ scrollback mouse altscreen (allows scrolling using Shift+MouseWheel.)
